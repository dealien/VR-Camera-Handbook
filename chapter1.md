# Getting Started

## Step 1: Taking Out The Cameras:

Before you begin filming, you have make sure that all necessary pieces are accounted for and are in the right places. When getting out all the separate components, make sure all the following pieces are accounted for.

If you want to film a complete 360 degree video, use the two cameras with the double camera mount.

If you are only going to film a 180 degree video, use the single camera mount.

The suction attachment is used to attach the camera to stationary flat wall or surface.

The handle mount is used for someone to hold and move the cameras while filming.

The control watch is used to synchronize starting and stopping a recording, and to make sure pictures are taken at exactly the same time.

Step 2: Camera Mechanical Assembly
To get you cameras ready to film, you have to assemble all of the mechanical parts that will form the camera mount
Unzip the camera case and take out the two cameras. 
For attaching the cameras to the double camera mount, take one camera and find the screw hole (this should be right below the camera lense and right above the SD card slot).

Once located, position on the mount so that the screw on the mount lines up with the screw hole on the camera. 
Use a flathead screwdriver to screw the camera into position. 
Do the same for the other camera on the other side of the mount. 
After the cameras are securely in position, swing the fastening bar into alignment with the threads at the bottom of the mount

After this, take out either the and or suction cup attachment or the hand attachment from the accessories box (box that does not contain cameras)
Position the threads on the suction or hand mount so that they are in between the threads on the double camera mount

Screw in the knob that came with the double mount into all of the threads until secure

 You now have the mechanical parts of the camera correctly set up
Step 3: Camera Calibration
If your camera are already set with the date and time, this step is not necessary.
Turn on both cameras by pushing the triangular power button until you hear a beep

If your cameras are not calibrated, on the screen it should show the date and time as zero
To set the date and time, use the the two triangular buttons (one of which is power) to move up and down the dates and the record button to move left and right by pressing down on either the left or right side of the button. To confirm your selected choice, press on the center of the record button
Make sure the calibration on both cameras are generally the same (it's okay if the time on the cameras are a little bit off)
Your cameras are now ready to be synced
Step 4: Syncing The Cameras
To make it so that you donâ€™t have to push the record the button separate on each camera, you must sync them to the control watch
