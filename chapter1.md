# Getting Set Up

Step 1: Taking Out The Camera(s):

* When getting out all the separate components, there will be two different boxes. The first box will contain the two cameras and all the necessary items to film with them. Box two will contain all of the useful accessories that come with the cameras. There will also be another instruction manual that you will not have to read.
* The first box will contain a case with the two cameras and lense covers, the control watch, and the cleaning cloth
* The second box contains the double camera mount, the single camera mount, the hand attachment, the suction cup attachment, to extra lense covers with cases, and an adjustment tool
* If you want to film a complete 360 degree video use the two cameras with the double camera mount. If you are only going to film a 180 degree video, use the single camera mount
* The suction attachment is used to attach the camera to stationary flat surface while the hand attachment is used for someone to hold and move the camera(s)
The control watch is used to sync and control the settings on the cameras
Step 2: Getting The Camera(s) Ready To Film
* Unzip the camera case and take out the two cameras
* For attaching the cameras to the double camera mount, take one camera and find the screw hole
