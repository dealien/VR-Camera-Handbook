* If you want to film a complete 360 degree video, use the two cameras with the double camera mount.
* If you are only going to film a 180 degree video, use the single camera mount.
* The control watch is used to synchronize starting and stopping a recording, and to make sure pictures are taken at exactly the same time.



## Camera Mechanical Assembly

To get your cameras ready to film, you have to assemble all of the mechanical parts that will form the camera mount. 

* Unzip the camera case and take out the two cameras.
* To attach the cameras to the double camera mount, find the screw holes on the cameras located between the camera lens and the SD card slot.
* Once located, position on the mount so that the screw on the mount lines up with the screw hole on the camera.
* Use a flathead screwdriver to screw the camera into position.
* Do the same for the other camera on the other side of the mount.
* After the cameras are securely in position, swing the fastening bar into alignment with the threads at the bottom of the mount
* Position the threads on the desired mount between the threads on the double camera mount
* Screw in the knob that came with the double mount into all of the threads until secure
* You now have the mechanical parts of the camera correctly set up



## Camera Calibration

If your cameras are already set with the date and time, this step is not necessary.
* Turn on both cameras by pressing <span>record</span> until you hear a beep
* If your cameras are not calibrated, on the screen it should show the date and time as zero
* To set the date and time, use the the two triangular buttons <span>power</span> and <span>menu</span>to move up and down the dates and the record button to move left and right by pressing down on either the left or right side of the button. To confirm your selected choice, press on the center of the record button
* Make sure the calibration on both cameras are generally the same (it is okay if the time on the cameras is not exactly the same as long as they’re generally accurate)
* Your cameras are now ready to be synced



## Syncing the Cameras and Using The Control Watch

Syncing the cameras to the control watch allows for simultaneous control of both cameras. This reduces the time difference between the start frames of the recording, making editing easier.
* Turn on both cameras.
* Press <span>menu</span> and scroll until you see <span>pair_settings</span> and press <span>record</span>.
* Scroll to <span>multi_pair</span> and press <span>record</span>, then select <span>pairing_confirm</span>.
* Follow these steps on both cameras.
* Once you see <span>pairing_process</span> on both cameras, press both buttons on the watch until BOTH cameras show <span>pairing_success</span>.
* Now both cameras can be controlled using the watch for taking bot pictures and videos.



## Using The Mounts

Once you are ready to film, it is very important you know how to use the mount you intend to film with so you do not break it and so you can get the best film quality.

##### With The Suction Mount

* Find a completely smooth and flat area to attach your camera’s to
* Hold the mount firmly against the surface and push down the hand on the mount to secure it.
* Your suction mount is now in place and ready to film

##### With Hand Mount

* Simply hold the mount in your hand



## Charging The Batteries

If you are using the cameras for a long period of time you are going to need to charge the batteries. This section is about charging a battery connected by usb to your computer and not charging using the charging port. In the quick start guide that comes with the cameras, it tells you how to charge the batteries using the charging port.

* Get a micro USB to USB cable
* Plug the micro USB end into the camera and the USB end into your computer
* As long as the camera is off the battery should start charging
* Estimated time for charging is about two hours. It may take longer and if so, just keep charging for a longer time



## Before Filming Things to Double Check

* Are both batteries charged?
* Are both mini SD cards in camera?
* Are the cameras securely put on the mount?
* Is there any dirt or dust on the cameras’ lenses?
* Are the camera’s synced up?
